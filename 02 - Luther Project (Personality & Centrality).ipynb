    "We'll learn about web scraping using two popular tools - BeautifulSoup and Selenium. You'll have to know the very basics of HTML. We'll also be evolving the way we use IPython notebooksâ€”during this project we'll begin to use the notebook as a development scratchpad, where we test things out through interactive scripting, but then solidify our work in python modules with reusable functions and classes.\n",
